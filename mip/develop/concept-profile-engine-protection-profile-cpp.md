# Protection API profile

The two examples below show how to create the profileSettings object using local storage for state storage as well as in-memory only. Both assume that the `authDelegateImpl` object has already been created.

## Load a Profile

Now that the [`ProtectionProfileObserverImpl`]() and [`AuthDelegateImpl`]() are defined, we'll use the them to instantiate `mip::ProtectionProfile`. Creating the `mip::ProtectionProfile` object requires [`mip::ProtectionProfile::Settings`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/develop/mip/class_mip_ProtectionProfile_settings).

### ProtectionProfile::Settings Parameters

- `std::string path`: File path under which logging, telemetry, and other persistent state is stored.
- `bool useInMemoryStorage`: Defines whether or not all state should be stored in memory as opposed to on disk.
- `std::shared_ptr<mip::AuthDelegate> authDelegate`: A shared pointer of class `mip::AuthDelegate` (See [Auth Section]())
- `std::shared_ptr<mip::ProtectionProfile::Observer> observer`: A shared pointer to the [`ProtectionProfile::Observer`]() implementation.
- `mip::ApplicationInfo applicationInfo`: object. Used to define info regarding application that is consuming the SDK.

The two examples below show how to create the profileSettings object using local storage for state storage as well as in-memory only. Both assume that the `authDelegateImpl` object has already been created.

#### Store state in memory only

```cpp
ProtectionProfile::Settings profileSettings(
    "",                                     //path to store settings
    true,                                   //useInMemoryStorage
    authDelegateImpl,                       //auth delegate object
    std::make_shared<ConsentDelegateImpl>(),//new consent delegate
    std::make_shared<ProtectionProfileObserverImpl>(), //new protection profile observer
    mip::ApplicationInfo{ "MyClientId", "MyAppFriendlyName" }); //ApplicationInfo object
```

#### Read/write profile settings from storage path on disk

```cpp
ProtectionProfile::Settings profileSettings(
    "./mip_app_data",                       //path to store settings
    false,                                  //useInMemoryStorage
    authDelegateImpl,                       //auth delegate object
    std::make_shared<ConsentDelegateImpl>(),//new consent delegate
    std::make_shared<ProtectionProfileObserverImpl>(), //new protection profile
    mip::ApplicationInfo{ "MyClientId", "MyAppFriendlyName" }); //ApplicationInfo object
```

Next, use the promise/future pattern to load the `ProtectionProfile`.

```cpp
auto profilePromise = std::make_shared<std::promise<std::shared_ptr<ProtectionProfile>>>();
auto profileFuture = profilePromise->get_future();
ProtectionProfile::LoadAsync(profileSettings, profilePromise);
```

If we've loaded a profile, and that operation was successful, `ProtectionProfileObserverImpl::OnLoadSuccess`, our implementation of `mip::ProtectionProfile::Observer::OnLoadSuccess` is called. The resulting object or exception pointer, as well as the context, are passed in as parameters to the function. The context is a pointer to the `std::promise` we created to handle the async operation. The function simply sets the value of the promise to the ProtectionProfile object (context). When the main function uses `Future.get()`, the result can be stored in a new object.

```cpp
//get the future value and store in profile.
auto profile = profileFuture.get();
```

### Putting it Together

Having fully implemented the observers and authentication delegate, it's now possible to fully load a profile. The code snip below assumes all necessary headers are already included.

```cpp
int main()
{
    const string userName = "MyTestUser@contoso.com";
    const string password = "P@ssw0rd!";
    const string clientId = "MyClientId";
    auto authDelegateImpl = make_shared<sample::auth::AuthDelegateImpl>(userName, password, clientId);

    ProtectionProfile::Settings profileSettings("",
        false,
        authDelegateImpl,
        std::make_shared<ConsentDelegateImpl>(),
        std::make_shared<ProfileObserver>(),
        mip::ApplicationInfo{ "MyClientId", "MyAppFriendlyName" });

    auto profilePromise = std::make_shared<promise<shared_ptr<ProtectionProfile>>>();
    auto profileFuture = profilePromise->get_future();
    ProtectionProfile::LoadAsync(profileSettings, profilePromise);
    auto profile = profileFuture.get();
}
```

The end result being that we've successfully loaded the profile and stored in the object called `profile`.

## Next Steps

Now that the profile has been added, the next step is to add an engine to the profile.
