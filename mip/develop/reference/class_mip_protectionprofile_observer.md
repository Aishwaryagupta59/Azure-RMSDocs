## Members
  
### OnLoadSuccess
Called when profile was loaded successfully.

Parameters:  
* **profile**: A reference to the newly-created [ProtectionProfile](class_mip_protectionprofile.md)


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::AddEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#addengineasync)


An application can pass any type of context (e.g. std::promise, std::function, etc.) to [ProtectionProfile::AddEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#addengineasync) and that same context will be forwarded as-is to [ProtectionProfile::Observer::OnLoadSuccess](class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md#onloadsuccess) or [ProtectionProfile::Observer::OnLoadFailure](class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md#onloadfailure)
  
### OnLoadFailure
Called when loading a profile caused an error.

Parameters:  
* **error**: [Error](class_mip_error.md) that occurred while loading 


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::AddEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#addengineasync)


An application can pass any type of context (e.g. std::promise, std::function, etc.) to [ProtectionProfile::AddEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#addengineasync) and that same context will be forwarded as-is to [ProtectionProfile::Observer::OnLoadSuccess](class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md#onloadsuccess) or [ProtectionProfile::Observer::OnLoadFailure](class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md#onloadfailure)
  
### OnListEnginesSuccess
Called when list of engines was generated successfully.

Parameters:  
* **engineIds**: a list of engine ids the are available. 


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::ListEnginesAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#listenginesasync)


  
### OnListEnginesError
Called when listing engines resulted in an error.

Parameters:  
* **error**: the error that cause the list engines operation to fail. 


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::ListEnginesAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#listenginesasync)


  
### OnAddEngineSuccess
Called when a new engine was added successfully.

Parameters:  
* **engine**: Newly-created engine 


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::AddEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#addengineasync)


  
### OnAddEngineError
Called when adding a new engine resulted in an error.

Parameters:  
* **error**: the error that cause the add engine operation to fail. 


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::AddEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#addengineasync)


  
### OnDeleteEngineSuccess
Called when an engine was deleted successfully.

Parameters:  
* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::DeleteEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#deleteengineasync)


  
### OnDeleteEngineError
Called when deleting an engine resulted in an error.

Parameters:  
* **error**: the error that cause the delete engine operation to fail. 


* **context**: The same context that was passed to [ProtectionProfile::DeleteEngineAsync](class_mip_protectionprofile.md#deleteengineasync)
