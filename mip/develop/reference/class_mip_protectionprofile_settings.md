### Settings
[ProtectionProfile::Settings](class_mip_protectionprofile_settings.md) constructor that specifies an observer to be used for async operations.

Parameters:  
* **path**: File path under which logging, telemetry, and other protection collateral is stored 


* **useInMemoryStorage**: Store any cached state in memory rather than on disk 


* **authDelegate**: Callback object to be used for authentication, implemented by client application 


* **observer**: [Observer](class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md) instance that will receive notifications of events related to [ProtectionProfile](class_mip_protectionprofile.md)


* **applicationInfo**: Info about application that is consuming the protection SDK


  
### Settings
[ProtectionProfile::Settings](class_mip_protectionprofile_settings.md) constructor, used for synchronous operations.

Parameters:  
* **path**: File path under which logging, telemetry, and other protection collateral is stored 


* **useInMemoryStorage**: Store any cached state in memory rather than on disk 


* **authDelegate**: Callback object to be used for authentication, implemented by client application 


* **applicationInfo**: Info about application which is consuming the protection SDK


  
### GetPath
Gets the path under which logging, telemetry, and other protection collateral is stored.

  
**Returns**: Path under which logging, telemetry, and other protection collateral is stored
  
### GetUseInMemoryStorage
Get whether or caches are stored in memory only (as opposed to on disk)

  
**Returns**: True if caches are stored in memory only
  
### GetAuthDelegate
Gets the auth delegate used for acquiring authentication tokens.

  
**Returns**: Auth delegate used for acquiring authentication tokens
  
### ConsentDelegate
Gets the consent delegate used for connecting to services.

  
**Returns**: Consent delegate used for connecting to services
  
### ProtectionProfile::Observer
Gets the observer that receives notifications of events related to [ProtectionProfile](class_mip_protectionprofile.md).

  
**Returns**: [Observer](class_mip_protectionprofile_observer.md) that receives notifications of events related to [ProtectionProfile](class_mip_protectionprofile.md)
  
### ApplicationInfo
Gets info about application that is consuming the protection SDK.

  
**Returns**: Info about application that is consuming the protection SDK
  
### OptOutTelemetry
Opts out of all telemetry gathering.
  
### IsTelemetryOptedOut
Gets if telemetry gathering should be disabled or not.

  
**Returns**: If telemetry gathering should be disabled or not
  
### LoggerDelegate
Get the logger delegate (if any) provided by the application.

  
**Returns**: Logger
  
### SetLoggerDelegate
Override default logger.

Parameters:  
* **loggerDelegate**: Logging callback interface implemented by client applications


This method should be called by client applications that use their own logger implementation
  
### HttpDelegate
Get the HTTP delegate (if any) provided by the application.

  
**Returns**: HTTP delegate to be used for HTTP operations
  
### SetHttpDelegate
Override default HTTP stack with client's own.

Parameters:  
* **httpDelegate**: HTTP callback interface implemented by client application


  
### GetSkipTelemetryInit
Gets if telemetry initialization should be skipped or not.

  
**Returns**: If telemetry initialization should be skipped or not
  
### SetSkipTelemetryInit
Disables telemetry initialization.
This method is not typically called by client applications, rather it is used by File SDK to prevent duplicate initialization
  
### SetNewFeaturesDisabled
Disables new features.
For applications that don't want to try new features
  
### AreNewFeaturesDisabled
Gets if new features are disabled or not.

  
**Returns**: If new features are disabled or not
  
### SetSessionId
Sets the session ID.

Parameters:  
* **sessionId**: Session ID that will be used to correlate logs/telemetry


  
### GetSessionId
Gets the session ID.

  
**Returns**: Session ID that will be used to correlate logs/telemetry
  
### SetMinimumLogLevel
Set the minimum log level that will trigger a logging event.

Parameters:  
* **logLevel**: minimum log level that will trigger a logging event. 



  
**Returns**: True
  
### LogLevel
Get the Minimum Log Level object.

  
**Returns**: Minimum log level that will trigger a logging event.
