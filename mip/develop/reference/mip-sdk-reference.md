# MIP SDK for C++ (Preview) Reference

The Microsoft Information Protection (MIP) SDK for C++ (Preview) allows developers to manage and apply data protection policies to data and other digital assets.  

To learn more, see [MIP Developer blog](https://aka.ms/MIPDevelopers)<!-- and [MIP samples](https://aka.ms/mipsdksamples)-->.

The MIP SDK for C++ includes:

- [Enumerations and structures](mip-enums-and-structs.md)
- [Functions](mip-functions.md)
- The following classes:

[HttpRequest](class_mip_httprequest.md)  |  Interface that describes a single HTTP request.
[HttpResponse](class_mip_httpresponse.md)  |  Interface that describes a single HTTP response, implemented by client app when overriding [HttpDelegate](class_mip_httpdelegate.md).
[InternalError](class_mip_internalerror.md)  |  Internal error. This error is thrown when something unexpected happens during execution.
[JustificationRequiredError](class_mip_justificationrequirederror.md)  | _Not yet documented._
[JustifyAction](class_mip_justifyaction.md)  |  Justify [Action](class_mip_action.md) requires providing a justification to a label downgrade and setting the response in the execution state.

[PolicyEngine::Settings](class_mip_policyengine_settings.md)  |  Defines the settings associated with a [PolicyEngine](class_mip_policyengine.md).
[PolicyEngine](class_mip_policyengine.md)  |  This class provides an interface for all engine functions.
[PolicyHandler](class_mip_policyhandler.md)  |  This class provides an interface for all policy handler functions on a file.

[RecommendLabelAction](class_mip_recommendlabelaction.md)  |  Recommend label actions is meant to suggest a label to the users. Suppressing this call after a user ignores the recommended label should be done through the supported actions on the execution state.
