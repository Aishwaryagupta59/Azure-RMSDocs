# Applications that support Azure Rights Management data protection

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*


Use the following tables to identify the applications and solutions that natively support the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS), which provides the data protection for Azure Information Protection.

For these applications and solutions, Rights Management support is tightly integrated by using the Rights Management APIs to support usage restrictions. These applications and solutions are also known as "RMS-enlightened."

Unless stated otherwise, the supported capabilities apply to both Azure RMS and AD RMS. In addition, AD RMS support on iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows Phone 8.1 requires [Active Directory Rights Management Services Mobile Device Extension](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn673574.aspx).

## RMS-enlightened applications

The following table displays RMS-enlightened client applications from Microsoft and software vendors. 

For information about viewing protected PDF documents, see [Protected PDF readers for Microsoft Information Protection](./rms-client/protected-pdf-readers.md).

Information about the table columns:

-   **Email:** The email clients that are listed can protect the email message itself, which automatically protects any attached Office files that are not already protected. In this scenario, the client’s preview feature can display the protected content (message and attachment) to authorized recipients. However, if an email message itself is not protected but the attachment is protected, the client’s preview feature cannot display the protected attachment to authorized recipients. 
    
    Tip: For email clients that don't support protecting emails, consider using [Exchange Online mail flow rules to apply this protection](https://support.office.com/article/define-mail-flow-rules-to-encrypt-email-messages-in-office-365-9b7daf19-d5f2-415b-bc43-a0f5f4a585e8).

-   **Other file types**: Text and image files include files that have a file name extension such as .txt, .xml, .jpg, and .jpeg. These files change their file name extension after they are natively protected by Rights Management, and become read-only. Files that cannot be natively protected have a .pfile file name extension after they are generically protected by Rights Management. For more information, see the [File types supported](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-file-types.md) from the Azure Information Protection client admin guide.

###### Footnote 1
Supported only with SharePoint Online and OneDrive for Business, and the documents are unprotected before they are uploaded to a protected library.

###### Footnote 2
For [Office attachments](https://support.office.com/article/bb643d33-4a3f-4ac7-9770-fd50d95f58dc#FileTypesforIRM) that are protected by using [Office 365 Message Encryption with the new capabilities](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Security-Privacy-and-Compliance/Email-Encryption-and-Rights-Protection/ba-p/110801).

###### Footnote 3
If the sender and the recipient are part of the same organization. Or either of the following conditions:

- The sender or the recipient are using Exchange Online.

- The sender is using Exchange on-premises in a hybrid configuration. 

###### Footnote 4
Uses Exchange ActiveSync IRM, which must be enabled by the Exchange administrator. Users can view, reply, and reply all for protected email messages but users cannot protect new email messages.
 
If the email application cannot render the message because the Exchange ActiveSync IRM is not enabled, the recipient can view the email in a web browser when the sender uses Exchange Online, or Exchange on-premises in a hybrid configuration. 



### More information about Azure RMS support for Office

Azure RMS is tightly integrated into the Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook apps, where this functionality is often referred to as Information Rights Management (IRM). 

See also: [Office Applications Service Description](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/office-applications-service-description.aspx)

#### Windows computers for Information Rights Management (IRM)

The following Office client suites support protecting files and emails on Windows computers by using the Azure Rights Management service:

- Office 365 with Office 2016 apps (minimum version 1805, build 9330.2078) when the user is assigned a license for Azure Rights Management (also known as Azure Information Protection for Office 365)

- Office 365 ProPlus: Office 2016 and Office 2013
    
    These editions of Office are included with most but not all Office 365 subscriptions that include data protection from Azure Information Protection. Check your subscription information to see if Office 365 ProPlus is included. You'll also find this information in the [Azure Information Protection datasheet](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf).

- Office Professional Plus 2016

- Office Professional Plus 2013

- Office Professional Plus 2010 with Service Pack 2

All editions of Office (with the exception of Office 2007) support consuming protected content.

When you use the Azure Rights Management service with Office Professional Plus 2010 and Service Pack 2 or Office Professional 2010 with Service Pack 2:

- Requires the Azure Information Protection client for Windows or the Rights Management sharing application for Windows.

- Not supported on Windows 10.

- Does not support forms-based authentication for federated user accounts. These accounts must use Windows Integrated Authentication.

- Does not support overriding template protection with custom permissions that a user selects with the Azure Information Protection client. In this scenario, the original protection must first be removed before custom permissions can be applied.

#### Mac computers for Information Rights Management (IRM)

The following Office client suites support protecting files and emails on macOS by using Azure RMS:

- Office 365 ProPlus: Office 2016

- Office Standard 2016 for Mac

### More information about the Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android

The Azure Information Protection viewer app for iOS and Android replaces the RMS sharing app for these devices. It provides the same functionality and in addition, supports rights-protected email messages and rights-protected PDF files on SharePoint Online.

If your iOS and Android devices are enrolled by Microsoft Intune, you can deploy and manage this app by using a policy managed app. For more information, see [Configure and deploy mobile application management policies in the Microsoft Intune console](/intune/deploy-use/configure-and-deploy-mobile-application-management-policies-in-the-microsoft-intune-console) from the Intune documentation. For Step 2 from this Intune documentation, use the instructions to publish a policy managed app.

For more information, see the [FAQ for Microsoft Azure Information Protection app for iOS and Android](./rms-client/mobile-app-faq.md).


### More information about the Azure Information Protection client for Windows

This client now replaces the Rights Management sharing application for Windows.
