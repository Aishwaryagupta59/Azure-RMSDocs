## Next steps

For more information about editing the Azure Information Protection policy settings, see [How to configure the policy settings for Azure Information Protection](configure-policy-settings.md).

The policy settings that we changed helped to ensure a base level of classification, as well as encourage users to select an appropriate label. The next step is to augment this strategy by inspecting the contents of documents and emails, and then recommending or automatically applying an appropriate label. You do this by configuring labels for conditions. To learn more, see [How to configure conditions for automatic and recommended classification for Azure Information Protection](configure-policy-classification.md).
