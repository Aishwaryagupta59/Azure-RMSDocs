# The default Azure Information Protection policy

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

Use the following information to understand how the default policy for Azure Information Protection is configured.

When an administrator first connects to the Azure Information Protection service by using the Azure portal, the default policy for that tenant is created. Occasionally, Microsoft might make changes to the default policy but if you were already using the service before the default policy was revised, your earlier version of the default policy is not updated because you might have configured it and deployed into production.

You can reference the following values to return your policy to the defaults, or update your policy to the latest values.

## Current default policy

This version of the default policy is from July 31, 2017.

This default policy is created when the Azure Rights Management service is activated, which is the case for new tenants starting February 2018. For more information, see the blog post announcement [Improvements to the protection stack in Azure Information Protection](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/enterprisemobility/2018/03/08/improvements-to-the-protection-stack-in-azure-information-protection).

This default policy is also created if you have manually [activated the service](activate-service.md) before the policy was created. 

If the service was not activated, the default policy does not configure protection for the following sublabels:

- **Confidential \ All Employees**

- **Confidential \ Recipients Only**

- **Highly Confidential \ All Employees** 

- **Highly Confidential \ Recipients Only** 

When these sublabels are not automatically configured for protection, the default policy remains the same as the [previous default policy](#default-policy-before-july-31-2017).

When protection is applied to the **All Employees** sublabels, the protection is configured by using the default templates that are automatically converted to labels in the Azure portal. For more information about these templates, see [Configuring and managing templates for Azure Information Protection](configure-policy-templates.md).

Starting August 30, 2017, this version of the default policy includes multi-language versions of the label names and descriptions. 

#### More information about the Recipients Only sublabel

Users see this label in Outlook only. They do not see this label in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, or from File Explorer. 

When users select this label, the Outlook Do Not Forward option is automatically applied to the email. The recipients that the users specify cannot forward the email and cannot copy or print the contents, or save any attachments.

## Default policy before July 31, 2017

Note that descriptions in this policy refer to data that requires protection, and also to data tracking and revoking. The policy does not configure this protection for these labels, so you must take additional steps to fulfill this description. For example, configure the label to apply protection or use a data loss prevention (DLP) solution. Before you can track and revoke a document by using the document tracking site, the document must be protected by the Azure Rights Management service and tracked by the person who protected the document.
