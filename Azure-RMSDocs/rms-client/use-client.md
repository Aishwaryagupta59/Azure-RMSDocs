# The client side of Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 with SP1, Windows Server 2016, Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2*

Azure Information Protection provides a client-server solution that helps to protect an organization's documents and emails:

- The client can be the Azure Information Protection client (classic), the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, or the Rights Management client. Whichever of these clients you use, it integrates with applications that you run on computers and mobile devices. 
- The service resides in the cloud (Azure Information Protection, which uses the Azure Rights Management service for the data protection) or on-premises (Active Directory Rights Management Services, more commonly known as AD RMS). 

The Azure Information Protection client (classic) and the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client supports classification and protection with labeling. The classic client also supports protection without labeling. Both clients integrate with Office applications and must be installed separately.

The Rights Management (RMS) client is automatically installed with some applications, such as Office applications, the Azure Information Protection client (classic) and Azure Information Protection unified labeling client, and RMS-enlightened applications from software vendors. However, it can also be [installed by itself](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38396), to support [synchronizing files from IRM-protected libraries and OneDrive for Business](https://support.office.com/article/Deploy-the-new-OneDrive-sync-client-in-an-enterprise-environment-3f3a511c-30c6-404a-98bf-76f95c519668), and for developers who want to integrate rights management protection into line-of-business applications.

## Choose which Azure Information Protection client to use

The **Azure Information Protection client (classic)** downloads labels and policy settings from the Azure portal. For more information about this client, see the [Azure Information Protection client: Version release history and support policy](client-version-release-history.md).

The **Azure Information Protection unified labeling client** downloads labels and policy settings from the admin centers: The Office 365 Security & Compliance Center, Microsoft 365 security center, and Microsoft 365 compliance center. For more information about this client, see the [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client: Version release information](unifiedlabelingclient-version-release-history.md).

Which client should you install?

- Install the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for labels and policy settings that can also be used by MacOS, iOS, and Android, and if you donâ€™t need the few features that aren't yet supported by the classic client. These features include protecting content with an on-premises key (HYOK) and a scanner for on-premises data stores.

- Install the Azure Information Protection client (classic) if you need a version of the client that has features that are not yet available with the unified labeling client. Your tradeoff is that not all label settings can be used on other client platforms, and administration using another management portal.

Currently, the classic client and the unified labeling client don't have parity for their features. However, this gap is closing and you can expect new features to be added only to the unified labeling client. For this reason, we recommend you deploy the unified labeling client if its current feature set and functionality meet your business requirements. If not, or if you have configured labels in the Azure portal that you haven't yet [migrated to the unified labeling store](../configure-policy-migrate-labels.md), use the classic client.

You can also install both clients in the same environment to support different business requirements, as demonstrated in the following example. For this scenario, we recommend you migrate the labels in the Azure portal so that both sets of clients share the same set of labels for ease of administration.

##### Example deployment strategy:

- For the majority of users, you deploy the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client because this client meets the business needs for these users. 
    
    For these users, their labeling experience is very similar across Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android because they have the same labels published to them and the same policy settings. As an admin, you manage these labels and policy settings in the same management portal.

- For a subset of users, you deploy the classic client because these users require one or more labels that apply hold your own key (HYOK) protection.
    
    For these users, they have a slightly different labeling experience when they use this client. For example, they see a **Protect** button in their Windows apps rather than a **Sensitivity** button in Office for Mac. As an admin, you need to manage their labels for HYOK settings and policy settings in a different management portal to the labels and settings for the other client platforms.

- You have on-premises data stores with documents that need to be scanned for sensitive information, or classified and protected. You deploy the classic client on servers to run the Azure Information Protection scanner.

#### Features not planned to be in the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client

Although the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client is still under development, the following features and behavior differences from the classic client are not currently planned to be available in future releases for the unified labeling client: 

- Support Office apps for disconnected computers with manual policy file management

- Custom permissions as an option that users can select in Office apps: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint

- Track and revoke from Office apps and File Explorer

- Information Protection bar title and tooltip

- Protection-only mode (no labels) using templates

- Protect PDF document as .ppdf format

- Display the Do Not Forward button in Outlook

- Demo policy

- Justification for removing protection

- Confirmation prompt **Do you want to delete this label?** for users when you don't use the policy setting for justification

- Label an Office document by using an existing custom property (SyncPropertyName and SyncPropertyState advanced client settings)

- Separate PowerShell cmdlets to connect to a Rights Management service


#### Parent labels and their sublabels 

The Azure Information Protection client (classic) doesn't support configurations that specify a parent label that has sublabels. These configurations include specifying a default label, and a label for recommended or automatic classification. When a label has sublabels, you can specify one of the sublabels but not the parent label.

For parity, the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client also doesn't support applying parent labels that have sublabels, even though you can select these labels in the admin centers. In this scenario, the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client will not apply the parent label.

- [RMS client deployment notes](client-deployment-notes.md)

Although the Azure Information Protection client (classic) can be used with AD RMS, this client is best suited to work with its Azure services; Azure Information Protection and its protection service, Azure Rights Management.
