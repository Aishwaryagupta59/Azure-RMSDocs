The Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows is a downloadable client for organizations that use [Office 365 sensitivity labels](https://docs.microsoft.com/Office365/SecurityCompliance/sensitivity-labels) to classify and protect documents and emails. This client also has a viewer for organizations that donâ€™t have their own information protection infrastructure but want to consume content that has been protected by other organizations that use a Rights Management service from Microsoft.

> [!NOTE]
> This client, also known as just the unified labeling client, is replacing the Azure Information Protection client (classic). If you're not sure which client to use, see [Choose which Azure Information Protection client to use](use-client.md#choose-which-azure-information-protection-client-to-use).
