# Rights Management sharing application user guide

>*Applies to: Active Directory Rights Management Services, [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), Windows 10, Windows 7 with SP1, Windows 8, Windows 8.1*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **End of support notification**: The Rights Management sharing application for Windows is being replaced by the [Azure Information Protection client](aip-client.md). Support for this older application will stop January 31, 2019. 

The Microsoft Rights Management (RMS) sharing application for Windows helps you keep important documents and pictures safe from people who shouldn’t see them, even if you email them or save them to another device. You can also use this application to open and use files that other people have protected by using the same Rights Management protection technology.

All you need is a computer that runs at least Windows 7 with Service Pack 1. Then [download and install](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970) this free application from Microsoft.

If you have questions that are not answered by this guide, see [FAQ for Microsoft Rights Management Sharing Application for Windows](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303971). This page also has some troubleshooting information, if you run into problems.
