### Servicing information and timelines

Each general availability (GA) version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client is supported for up to six months after the release of the subsequent GA version. The documentation does not include information about unsupported versions of the client. Fixes and new functionality are always applied to the latest GA version and will not be applied to older GA versions.
