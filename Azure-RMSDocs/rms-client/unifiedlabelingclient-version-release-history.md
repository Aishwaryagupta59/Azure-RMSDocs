> *Instructions for: [Azure Information Protection unified labeling client for Windows](../faqs.md#whats-the-difference-between-the-azure-information-protection-client-and-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client)*


You can download the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018).

After a short delay of typically a couple of weeks, the latest general availability version is also included in the Microsoft Update Catalog with a product name of **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** > **Microsoft Azure Information Protection Unified Labeling Client**, and the classification of **Updates**. This inclusion in the catalog means that you can upgrade the client by using WSUS or Configuration Manager, or other software deployment mechanisms that use Microsoft Update.

For more information, see [Upgrading and maintaining the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client](clientv2-admin-guide.md#upgrading-and-maintaining-the-azure-information-protection-unified-labeling-client).

### Servicing information and timelines

Each general availability (GA) version of the Azure Information Protection unified labeling client is supported for up to six months after the release of the subsequent GA version. The documentation does not include information about unsupported versions of the client. Fixes and new functionality are always applied to the latest GA version and will not be applied to older GA versions.

Preview versions should not be deployed for end users on production networks. Instead, use the latest preview version to see and try new functionality or fixes that are coming in the next GA version. Preview versions that are not current are not supported.

    - [Add "Report an Issue" for users](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#add-report-an-issue-for-users)
    - [Implement pop-up messages in Outlook that warn, justify, or block emails being sent](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#implement-pop-up-messages-in-outlook-that-warn-justify-or-block-emails-being-sent)
    - [Enable Azure Information Protection analytics to discover sensitive information in documents](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#enable-azure-information-protection-analytics-to-discover-sensitive-information-in-documents)
    - [Disable sending information type matches for a subset of users](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#disable-sending-information-type-matches-for-a-subset-of-users)
    - [Migrate labels from Secure Islands and other labeling solutions](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#migrate-labels-from-secure-islands-and-other-labeling-solutions)
    - [Apply a custom property when a label is applied](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#apply-a-custom-property-when-a-label-is-applied)

    - [Specify a color for the label](clientv2-admin-guide-customizations.md#specify-a-color-for-the-label)

- Support for labels that are configured for user-defined permissions for Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and File Explorer:
    - If you have labels with this configuration from the Azure portal, they are now supported by the unified labeling client although there is currently no equivalent configuration in the admin centers.
    - When a user selects a label with this configuration, they are prompted to select users and protection settings for the document.

- PowerShell changes in the AzureInformationProtection module:
    - New cmdlet: [New-AIPCustomPermissions](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/New-AIPCustomPermissions) - replaces New-RMSProtectionLicense to create an ad-hoc policy for custom permissions
    - New parameters:
        -  *CustomPermissions* and *RemoveProtection* - added to [Set-AIPFileLabel](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/Set-AIPFileLabel)
        -  *OnBeHalfOf* - added to [Set-AIPAuthentication](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/set-aipauthentication), to be used instead of the *Token* parameter for non-interactive sessions
        -  *WhatIf* and *DiscoveryInfoTypes* - added to [Set-AIPFileClassification](/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/set-aipfileclassification), so that this cmdlet can run in discovery mode without applying labels
    - Deprecated cmdlets: Clear-RMSAuthentication, Get-RMSFileStatus, Get-RMSServer, Get-RMSServerAuthentication, Get-RMSTemplate, Protect-RMSFile, Set-RMSServerAuthentication, Unprotect-RMSFile


**Fixes:**

- Support for [content matches](../reports-aip.md#content-matches-for-deeper-analysis) for analytics and [Set-AIPFileClassification](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azureinformationprotection/set-aipfileclassification?view=azureipps) with the *DiscoveryInfoTypes* parameter.

- When a label is removed from content, protection is also removed only when it was applied as part of the label configuration. If the protection was applied independently from the label, that protection is preserved. For example, a user applied custom permissions to a file.

- When automatic labeling is configured, the label applies the first time a document is saved.

## Version 2.0.779.0

**Released**: 05/01/2019

This release has a single fix to resolve a race-condition issue where sometimes, no labels display in Office apps or File Explorer.
