# How to configure conditions for automatic and recommended classification for Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

When you configure conditions for a label, you can automatically assign a label to a document or email. Or, you can prompt users to select the label that you recommend. 

When you configure these conditions, you can use predefined patterns, such as **Credit Card Number** or **USA Social Security Number (SSN)**. Or, you can define a custom string or pattern as a condition for automatic classification. These conditions apply to the body text in documents and emails, and to headers and footers. For more information about the conditions, see step 5 in the [following procedure](#to-configure-recommended-or-automatic-classification-for-a-label).

For the best user experience and to ensure business continuity, we recommend that you start with user recommended classification, rather than automatic classification. This configuration lets your users accept the classification and any associated protection, or override these suggestions if they are not suitable for their document or email message.

An example prompt for when you configure a condition to apply a label as a recommended action, with a custom policy tip:

![Azure Information Protection detection and recommendation](./media/info-protect-recommend-calloutsv2.png)

In this example, the user can click **Change now** to apply the recommended label, or override the recommendation by selecting **Dismiss**. If the user chooses to dismiss the recommendation and the condition still applies when the document is next opened, the label recommendation is displayed again. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>Do not configure a label for automatic classification and a user-defined permission. The user-defined permissions option is a [protection setting](configure-policy-protection.md) that lets users specify who should be granted permissions.
>
>When a label is configured for automatic classification and user-defined permissions, the content is checked for the conditions and the user-defined permission setting is not applied. You can use recommended classification and user-defined permissions.

## How automatic or recommended labels are applied

- Automatic classification applies to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint when documents are saved, and apply to Outlook when emails are sent. 
    
    You cannot use automatic classification for documents and emails that were previously manually labeled, or previously automatically labeled with a higher classification. 

- Recommended classification applies to Word, Excel, and PowerPoint when documents are saved. You cannot use recommended classification for Outlook unless you configure an [advanced client setting](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-customizations.md#enable-recommended-classification-in-outlook) that is currently in preview.
    
    You cannot use recommended classification for documents that were previously labeled with a higher classification. 

You can change this behavior so that the Azure Information Protection client periodically checks documents for the condition rules that you specify. This configuration requires an [advanced client setting](./rms-client/client-admin-guide-customizations.md#turn-on-classification-to-run-continuously-in-the-background) that is currently in preview.

### How multiple conditions are evaluated when they apply to more than one label

1. The labels are ordered for evaluation, according to their position that you specify in the policy: The label positioned first has the lowest position (least sensitive) and the label positioned last has the highest position (most sensitive).

2. The most sensitive label is applied.
 
3. The last sublabel is applied.


## To configure recommended or automatic classification for a label

1. If you haven't already done so, open a new browser window and [sign in to the Azure portal](configure-policy.md#signing-in-to-the-azure-portal). Then navigate to the **Azure Information Protection** blade. 
    
    For example, on the hub menu, click **All services** and start typing **Information** in the Filter box. Select **Azure Information Protection**.

2. From the **Classifications** > **Labels** menu option: On the **Azure Information Protection - Labels** blade, select the label to configure.

3. On the **Label** blade, in the **Configure conditions for automatically applying this label** section, click **Add a new condition**.

4. On the **Condition** blade, select **Information Types** if you want to use a predefined condition, or **Custom** if you want to specify your own:
    - For **Information Types**: Select from the list of available conditions, and then select the minimum number of occurrences and whether the occurrence should have a unique value to be included in the occurrence count.
        
        The information types use the Office 365 data loss prevention (DLP) sensitivity information types and pattern detection. You can choose from many common sensitive information types, some of which are specific for different regions. For more information, see [What the sensitive information types look for](https://support.office.com/article/What-the-sensitive-information-types-look-for-fd505979-76be-4d9f-b459-abef3fc9e86b) from the Office documentation.
        
        The list of information types that you can select from the Azure portal is periodically updated to include any new Office DLP additions. However, the list excludes any custom sensitive information types that you have defined and uploaded as a rule package to the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center.
        
        > [!IMPORTANT]
        > Some of the information types require a minimum version of the client. [More information](#sensitive-information-types-that-require-a-minimum-version-of-the-client) 
        
        When Azure Information Protection evaluates the information types that you select, it does not use the Office DLP confidence level setting but matches according to the lowest confidence.
    
    - For **Custom**: Specify a name and phrase to match, which must exclude quotation marks and special characters. Then specify whether to match as a regular expression, use case sensitivity, and the minimum number of occurrences and whether the occurrence should have a unique value to be included in the occurrence count.
        
        The regular expressions use the Office 365 regex patterns. To help you specify regular expressions for your custom conditions, see the following specific version of [Perl Regular Expression Syntax](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_37_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html) from Boost.
        
5. Decide whether you need to change the **Minimum number of occurrences** and the **Count occurrence with unique value only**, and then select **Save**. 
    
    Example of the occurrences options: You select the information type for the social security number, set the minimum number of occurrences as 2, and a document has the same social security number listed twice: If you set the **Count occurrences with unique value only** to **On**, the condition is not met. If you set this option to **Off**, the condition is met.

6. Back on the **Label** blade, configure the following, and then click **Save**:
    
    - Choose automatic or recommended classification: For **Select how this label is applied: automatically or recommended to user**, select **Automatic** or **Recommended**.
    
    - Specify the text for the user prompt or policy tip: Keep the default text or specify your own string.

When you click **Save**, your changes are automatically available to users and services. There's no longer a separate publish option.

### Sensitive information types that require a minimum version of the client

The following sensitive information types require a minimum version of 1.37.19.0 for the Azure Information Protection client:

- **EU Phone Number**
- **EU Mobile Phone Number**
- **EU Passport Number**
- **EU Driver's License Number**
- **EU GPS Coordinates**
- **EU National Identification Number**
- **EU Social Security Number (SSN) or Equivalent ID**
- **EU Tax Identification Number (TIN)**
- **Thai Population Identification Code**
- **Turkish National Identification number**
- **Japanese Residence Card Number**


## Next steps

Consider deploying the [Azure Information Protection scanner](deploy-aip-scanner.md), which can use your automatic classification rules to discover, classify, and protect files on network shares and on-premises file stores.
