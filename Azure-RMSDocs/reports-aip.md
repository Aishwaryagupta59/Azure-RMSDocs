# Central reporting for Azure Information Protection

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection)*

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is currently in preview and subject to change. Any data collected during this preview might not be supported when the feature moves to general availability.


Use Azure Information Protection analytics for central reporting to track the adoption of your Azure Information Protection labels, as well as monitor user access to labeled documents and emails, and any changes to their classification. You can also identify documents that contain sensitive information that must be protected.

The data that you see is aggregated from your Azure Information Protection clients, Azure Information Protection scanners, and [clients that support unified labeling](configure-policy-migrate-labels.md#clients-that-support-unified-labeling).

For example, you'll be able to see the following:

- From the **Usage report**, where you can select a time period:
    
    - Which labels are being applied
    
    - How many documents and emails are being labeled
    
    - How many documents and emails are being protected
    
    - How many users and how many devices are labeling documents and emails
    
    - Which applications are being used for labeling

- From the **Data discovery** report:

    - What files are on your scanned data repositories
    
    - Which files are labeled and protected, and the location of files by labels
    
    - Which files contain sensitive information for known categories, such as financial data and personal information, and the location of files by these categories
    
The reports use [Azure Log Analytics](/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-overview) to store the data in a workspace that you own. If you're familiar with the query language, you can modify the queries, and create new reports and Power BI dashboards. You might find the following tutorial helpful to understand the query language: [Getting Started with the Analytics Portal](https://docs.loganalytics.io/docs/Learn/Getting-Started/Getting-started-with-the-Analytics-portal). 

For more information, read the blog post: [Data discovery, reporting and analytics for all your data with Microsoft Information Protection](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Azure-Information-Protection/Data-discovery-reporting-and-analytics-for-all-your-data-with/ba-p/253854).

### Information collected and sent to Microsoft

To generate these reports, the endpoints send the following types of information to Microsoft:

- The label action. For example, set a label, change a label, add or remove protection, automatic and recommended labels.

- Your organization's tenant ID.

- The user ID (email address or UPN).

- The file path and file name of documents that are labeled.

- The Azure Information Protection client version.

- The client operating system version.

This information is stored in an Azure Log Analytics workspace that you own.

## Prerequisites for Azure Information Protection analytics
To view the Azure Information Protection reports and create your own, make sure that the following requirements are in place.

|Requirement|More information|
|---------------|--------------------|
|An Azure subscription that includes Log Analytics|See the [Azure Log Analytics pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/log-analytics) page.<br /><br />If you don't have an Azure subscription or you don't currently use Azure Log Analytics, the pricing page includes a link for a free trial.|
|The current preview version of the Azure Information Protection client.|If you haven't already installed the current preview version of the client, you can download and install it from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53018).|
|For the **Discovery and risk** report: <br /><br />- You have deployed at least one instance of the Azure Information Protection scanner (current preview version)|For installation instructions, see [Deploying the Azure Information Protection scanner to automatically classify and protect files](deploy-aip-scanner.md). <br /><br />If you're upgrading from a previous version of the scanner, see [Upgrading the Azure Information Protection scanner](./rms-client/client-admin-guide.md#upgrading-the-azure-information-protection-scanner).|


## Configure a Log Analytics workspace for the reports

1. If you haven't already done so, open a new browser window and [sign in to the Azure portal](configure-policy.md#signing-in-to-the-azure-portal). Then navigate to the **Azure Information Protection** blade. 
    
    For example, on the hub menu, click **All services** and start typing **Information** in the Filter box. Select **Azure Information Protection**.
    
2. Locate the **Manage** menu options, and select **Configure analytics (Preview)**.

3. On the **Azure Information Protection log analytics** blade, you see a list of any Log Analytics workspaces that are owned by your tenant. Do one of the following:
    
    - To create a new Log Analytics workspace: Select **Create new workspace**, and on the **Log analytics workspace** blade, supply the requested information.
    
    - To use an existing Log Analytics workspace: Select the workspace from the list.

If you need help creating the Log Analytics workspace, see [Create a Log Analytics workspace in the Azure portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-quick-create-workspace).

When the workspace is configured, you're ready to view the reports.

## How to view the reports

From the Azure Information Protection blade, locate the **Dashboards** menu options, and select one of the following options:

- **Usage report (Preview)**: Use this report to see how your labels are being used. 

- **Data discovery (Preview)**: Use this report to see information about files that the scanners found.

## How to modify the reports

Select the query icon in the dashboard to open a **Log Search** blade:

The logged data for Azure Information Protection is stored in the following table: **InformationProtectionLogs_CL**

## Next steps
After reviewing the information in the reports, you might decide to make changes to your Azure Information Protection policy. For instructions, see [Configuring the Azure Information Protection policy](configure-policy.md).
