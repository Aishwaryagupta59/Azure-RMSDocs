# Office apps: Configuration for clients to use the Azure Rights Management service

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*


Use this information to determine what you need to do so that Office apps work with the Azure Rights Management service from Azure Information Protection.

## Office 2019, Office 2016, and Office 2013
Because these later versions of Office natively support the Azure Rights Management service, no client computer configuration is required to support the information rights management (IRM) features for applications such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Outlook on the web. All users have to do, is sign in to their Office applications with their Office 365 credentials. They can then can protect files and emails, and use files and emails that have been protected by others.

## Office 2010
For client computers to use the Azure Rights Management service with Office 2010, they must have the Azure Information Protection client (classic). No further configuration is required other than users must sign in with their Office 365 credentials and they can then protect files and use files that have been protected by others.

For more information about the Azure Information Protection client (classic), see [Azure Information Protection client: Installation and configuration for clients](configure-client.md).
