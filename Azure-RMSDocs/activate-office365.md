# How to activate Rights Management protection from the Office 365 admin center

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

Use these instructions if you have access to the Azure Rights Management service from the Office 365 admin center. For example, you have a subscription for Office 365 E3 or Office 365 E5.

1. After you have signed up for an Office 365 plan that includes Azure Rights Management, [sign in to Office 365](https://portal.office.com/) with your work or school account that has the global administrator role for your OfficeÂ 365 deployment.

2. If the Office 365 admin center does not automatically display, select the app launcher icon in the upper-left and choose **Admin**. The **Admin** tile appears only to Office 365 administrators.

    > [!TIP]
    > For admin center help, see [About the Office 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-Admin-Center-758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23).

3. Navigate to the **rights management** page, or use the search functionality.
    
    - To navigate: **Settings** > **Services & add-ins** > **Microsoft Azure Information Protection** > **Manage Microsoft Azure Information Protection settings**
    
    - To search: In the search box on the **Home** page, type **rights management**, and from the search results, click **Azure rights management settings**, and then **Manage Microsoft Azure Information Protection settings**. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    >If you navigate to this option, depending on your display, you might need to scroll to see this option. However, if it is not listed on the page and it is not returned in the search results, it might be because your service plan does not include the Azure Rights Management service for Azure Information Protection.
    >
    >To activate the Azure Rights Management service, you must have either an [Azure Information Protection Premium plan](https://www.microsoft.com/cloud-platform/azure-information-protection-pricing) or an [Office 365 plan that includes Rights Management](http://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf). 
    
    If you need help activating the service or have questions about the subscription requirements, [contact Microsoft Support](information-support.md#to-contact-microsoft-support) or use your standard support channels.

4. On the **rights management** page, click **activate**.

5. When prompted **Do you want to activate Rights Management?**, click **activate**.

You should now see **Rights management is activated** and the option to deactivate.
