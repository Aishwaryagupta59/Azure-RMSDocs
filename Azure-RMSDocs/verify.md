# Verifying the Azure Rights Management service

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

When the Azure Rights Management service of Azure Information Protection is activated and you have performed any additional configuration steps that are required for your organization, you are ready to verify that this protection service is working as expected. 

A simple verification test is to protect a document or email message by using one user account, and then attempt to open and use that protected content from another user account on a different computer.

For instructions to complete this testing, see the information in [Helping users to protect files by using the Azure Rights Management service](help-users.md).

If your testing is unsuccessful, review the configuration steps in [Azure Information Protection deployment roadmap](deployment-roadmap.md).

> [!TIP]
> If you need additional help, see the [Support options and community resources](information-support.md#support-options-and-community-resources) section in the [Information and support for Azure Information Protection](information-support.md) article.
