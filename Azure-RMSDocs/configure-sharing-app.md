# Rights Management sharing application: Installation and configuration for clients

>*Applies to: [Azure Information Protection](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/information-protection), [Office 365](https://download.microsoft.com/download/E/C/F/ECF42E71-4EC0-48FF-AA00-577AC14D5B5C/Azure_Information_Protection_licensing_datasheet_EN-US.pdf)*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **End of support notification**: The Rights Management sharing application for Windows is being replaced by the [Azure Information Protection client](./rms-client/aip-client.md). Support for this older application will stop January 31, 2019. 
 
The RMS sharing application provides authentication support for Office 2010 and it integrates with Office applications by installing an Office add-in so that users can easily protect files and emails directly from the ribbon. This application also offers generic protection for files types that are not natively supported by the Azure Rights Management service, and a document tracking site for users to track and revoke files that they have protected.

## The RMS sharing application for Windows: Installation and configuration
For an enterprise installation and configuration of the RMS sharing application for Windows, see the [Rights Management sharing application administrator guide](./rms-client/sharing-app-admin-guide.md).

You can no longer download this application from the Microsoft Azure Information Protection page; the link for Windows computers now downloads the Azure Information Protection client. 


## The RMS sharing application for mobile platforms: Installation and management
You can download and install the RMS sharing app for Mac computers and Windows Phone devices from the [Microsoft Azure Information Protection page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=303970). 

You can no longer download the RMS sharing app for iOS and Android from this page; links for these mobile devices now download the Azure Information Protection client.
